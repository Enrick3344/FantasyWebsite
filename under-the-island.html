	<h3>Under The Island - Short Story</h3>
	<p class="date">Last updated 9/25/2017</p>
	<p>
Once upon a time in a far galaxy, was a magical island called Fantasy Island.<br> All the community was having a lot of fun playing and building the city, <br>except two of them who were working hard to keep the huge island the best place to visit.<br> The name of those hard workers is Oxal and Enrick. <br>Those two built the island and were there since the beginning. But that day,<br> Oxal woke up from a really strange dream, she dreamt about a gigantic<br> world under Fantasy Island, and that got her thinking,<br> is there something under Fantasy Island? Has Enrick been hiding<br> something under there. She decided to go to Enrick's room and wish him a good morning.
<br><br> - Good morning Enrick! How are you today?
<br> - Oh, hey Oxal! A little tired but great! How about you? Answered Enrick.
<br> - Well last night I had a really weird dream that got me thinking a lot!<br> Said Oxal while grabbing her head.
<br> - What was that dream geezus? Asked Enrick.
<br> Oxal explained all of her dream to Enrick, who was listening like never before,<br> he looked like he knew what she was talking about and it got her to ask<br> him the big question.
<br> - Is there really some kind of city under Fantasy Island or am I just crazy?
<br> - To be totally honest, there is a hidden city under Fantasy, though it has <br>been closed for good and no one ever went back there since it was closed<br> and we never talked about the Under Island City again. Answered Enrick
<br> - How can we get to the City? I NEED TO KNOW!??? Said Oxal with big stars in her eyes.
<br> - I don't you should go there. It's dangerous but I know you won't listen to me and you <br>will try to go there by yourself so I'm telling you right now if you REALLY <br>want to go there, I will go with you... I will let you think of it, I don't want<br> you to answer me right now! Take the night to think of it and come and tell me tomorrow.
<br>- Okay Boss! Have a good day! Yelled Oxal all Happy about the news
<br>She had been asking herself what kind of dangerous thing there could be there… animals,<br>monsters or maybe magical creatures. She thought of everything, at the end of <br>the day she went back in her house, but the nervosity and the extreme thinking kept her<br> awake a big part of the night. On that not sleeping time she packed some stuff <br>she may need in the city like ropes, clothes, food, a lot of food, water bottles,<br> rubber band, etc. She was all packed up and ready to sleep!
<br>
<br>After a good three hours of sleep, Oxal woke up and went<br> to take a good shower before going on the big adventure, because she knew there was probably no shower there <br>since it was closed. After the shower time, comes the coffee time. Then she took her suit <br>case and walked to work. When she arrived, Enrick was already there, she told herself he<br> probably stayed here all night working on his stuff. She still decided to walk up to him<br> to give him the answer she has been wanting to give.
<br><br>- Good morning cutie! How you doing?
<br>- Good morning babe! Oh, I'm good! answered Enrick with a huge smile on his face.
<br>Before Oxal got time to tell him her answer, Enrick said 
<br>- have you packed up everything you needed to go to the Under Island City?
<br>surprised she told him everything she put in her suit case.
<br>- That's good! Hope you are ready because we are going as<br>soon as Terra and Lewis will come here. They will run the Island <br>while we will be away! Said Enrick.
<br>- Wow how do you knew I wanted to go? Asked Oxal...
<br>- I know you oxal, by asking you to answer me later it<br> gave me time to prepare everything I needed to do before I would go away<br> with you, and before you ask, no I have not slept today.<br> replied Enrick after taking a huge sip of his coffee.
<br>- Oh right... I'll let you work now, bye cya later!
<br>Oxal went back to her office and started her everyday work<br> but she was really impatient for the amazing trip she was about to have! 
<br>A few hours later, Terra and Lewis entered the building, and <br>because of the excitement, Oxal couldn't contain her emotions.
<br><br>- HIII TERRA AND LEWIS!! I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU OMG! Yelled Oxal while jumping.
<br>- Oh, hi Oxal. Have a nice adventure! You better tell me everything <br>you saw there when you get back. Said Terra.
<br>- Yes of course I will! Replied Oxal.
<br>- Yeah have fun there! Said Lewis.
<br>- Thanks Lew Lew! Replied oxal with a big smile.
<br>Oxal ran to Enrick's room and entered like a kid at Christmas.
<br>- TERRA AND LEWIS ARE HERE! Can we go now? 
<br>- Yes we can! let me close my computer. Answered Enrick.
<br>- Okay I will go get my stuff!
<br>After they both got their stuff and packed it all in the car, Enrick <br>drove in some places Oxal never saw. Before, she felt like she knew every little hidden <br>place of Fantasy Island, but now she feels like she just a newbie! <br>Enrick warned her it would be a really long ride and that she should bring her charger or her <br>headphones. On the way there, she slept about 1 hours and the rest she listened to her music. 
<br>After a couple of hours, Enrick said they have arrived, but when Oxal looked<br> around all she was able to see was trees and a really old abandoned house that could<br> fall in one thousand pieces if the wind was too rough. 
<br><br>- Hmm... I think we are at the wrong place. All I can see is<br>trees and an old house. Said Oxal.
<br>- No trust me we are at the right place. I've been here a thousand <br>of times. Replied Enrick with a little cute smile. Follow me and I hope you<br> are ready to see what's under Fantasy Island.
<br>- Oh, yasss I am ready! Replied Oxal all excited.
<br>Oxal followed Enrick in the really old house. She didn't want<br> to admit it in front of him but the house was kind of scary... Enrick took the beautiful <br>red carpet on the floor and asked Oxal to remove it with him. Under this<br> carpet was a huge carpet with a sign on it saying "Do Not Open!". But Enrick didn’t<br> seem to care and just opened it. When he opened it, a really hot wind came out and hit the face of Oxal.
<br>- You should remove your coat Oxal. It's really hot down there. Said Enrick.
<br>- Okay... Replied Oxal.
<br>As she was walking to the car, she fell on the floor because of a rock. She<br> was kind of embarrassed but she continued walking to the car. Then she walked back<br> to Enrick and fell again on that stupid rock... This time Enrick laugh a little bit. 
<br>- Are you done kissing the floor? Said Enrick while laughing.
<br>- Hahaha really funny. Replied Oxal really embarrassed.
<br>- You ready to go? Asked Enrick to the best floor kisser.
<br>- Yeah, I guess. Let's go! Replied Oxal.
<br>Enrick told Oxal to follow him into the really dark cavern in the floor.
<br>
<br>Everything was really dark and they could hear really <br>strange noises from creatures she never heard of before. All those weird noises were getting<br> louder and louder every second and Oxal was getting a little scared but she <br>was excited at the same time. When suddenly something touched her foot. Oxal yelled like she<br> never yelled before and jumped on Enrick.
<br><br>- WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT!? IT TOUCHED MY FOOT. 
<br>- That was probably just plant or something, There's a lot of them down here.<br> You'll have to get use to them. Replied En.
<br>- Oh yeah... You're probably right. 
<br>As they were walking into the long cavern, Oxal couldn't stop asking herself what <br>the Under Fantasy was going to look like. Maybe a really exotic or like floral place <br>or like really dark with lava everywhere. She really couldn’t figure it out.
<br>After a while walking in the darkness, they finally got to a really strange rock <br>door with leaf all over it, but Oxal saw multiple little circle on the really weird entrance.<br> Enrick asked Oxal to hold his phone while he was searching for something. Oxal was wondering<br> what Enrick was searching, when he took a really shiny purple ore. He told Her to back off a little bit and placed<br> the magnificent ore in one of the little round on that old door. Suddenly, the door <br>started cracking and finally cracked open to leads to the Under Island. Oxal was<br> speechless. She couldn't speak or move.
<br>She was just there looking at all the Exotic world there was out there. She never<br> knew all those stuffs were hiding under their famous Fantasy Island. So much plants and trees<br> everywhere, but not like the common pink trees, no, some purple and blue trees! A lot of <br>magical creatures of all kind were running, swimming and flying all around. It was huge and so impressive, she was so <br>impressed that she almost walked on a creature that was on the floor.
<br><br>- Hey Oxal look where you walk! Yelled Enrick!
<br>- Oh, sorry little creature! What's the name of that kind of animal? Asked Oxal.
<br>- It's called a Lavadia. It’s a kind of reptile that could be very helpful for us! they love humans but <br>they probably haven’t seen one in a long time. When a Lavadia choses you, no others can get to you, he <br>will protect you till he dies. Replied Enrick while picking up the little reptile on the floor and putting<br> it in Oxal hand.
<br>- Aww he is so cute! We should give him a name! What about ruby? Said Oxal.
<br>- Great name, but we should continue, there’s still a lot of stuff you haven't seen.7
<br>- Oh, okay let's go then! Answered Oxal.
<br>After walking in the really dense jungle for what seem like 3h, they finally got in a really <br>old village made entirely of cobblestone. That village looked like no one has been taking care of it for a really <br>long time. As they were walking on the gravel path, Oxal noticed a really strange and almost scary black shadow.
<br>- Euhhh Enrick... Do you see that? Whispered Oxal.
<br>- See what? I don't see anything. Answered Enrick.
<br>- Don't you see the really scary shadow there? Oxal pointed the place where she saw it but it was gone.
<br>Enrick looked around but saw nothing.
<br>- No I don't see it! Let's go I want to show you something. There's<br> this house that seems to be open! Want to look inside? Asked Enrick.
<br>- Euhh I guess... Said Oxal kind of scared and worried about the shadow that disappeared.
<br>As they were entering, Enrick stopped, the shadow was there in front of him.
<br>- Oxal don't move... Now I see the shadow. Whispered Enrick.
<br>- Ah see! I told you. Replied Oxal.
<br>Enrick noticed the shadow was getting closer and closer to them. 
<br>- Oxal get back outside really slowly, don't make any sudden moves. Whispered En.
<br>As she was walking back outside she missed a stair and fell on the floor,<br> suddenly the creature started running towards them. 
<br>- Quick Oxal get up! Yelled Enrick.
<br>Suddenly the shadow stopped and started talking.
<br><br>- Heyy are you okay? Said the creature
<br>- Who are you? Show yourself. Said Enrick.
<br>The dark shadow walked out of the house and revealed what kind of creature she was.
<br>- Hi... I'm Dawn... I'm the last Azadia of the Under Island... I'm sorry if I scared you... <br>I just want to have people to talk to, I've been alone for a really long time.
<br>- Oh well welcome in our team I guess! Said Enrick with a big smile on his face.
<br>- May I ask one question? Asked Oxal.
<br>- Sure! Answered Dawn.
<br>- What is a Azadia? 
<br>- An Azadia is me. They were my family, Members of my community. We lived in that little village<br> and we loved to take care of little creatures that needed help... answered Dawn.
<br>- Ah okay thanks you! Answered Oxal.
<br>- As you can see you found a Lavadia! You're lucky they are rare. Said Dawn.
<br>- Yeah, I almost walked on him but Enrick told me he chose me so now he is following me. Heyy do<br> you want to come with us? Asked Oxie
<br>- Really? Omg thank you so much! Answered Dawn.
<br>- Let's go now! We will stop at the huge pound of water up there for the night. Said Enrick.
<br>On the way to the pound, Oxal and Dawn had a really long conversation about creatures, food and a lot of others topic.
<br>Arrived at the pound of water it was night and Enrick laid on the floor to sleep. Oxal and Dawn did the <br>exact same thing. The water sound was really relaxing and in a second, all of them were sleeping. 
<br>Oxal had an awesome dream that night. She dreamt about all the creatures and about everything she saw in the day.<br> But that didn't last long when she heard:
<br><br>- Good Morning Oxal. Said nicely Enrick.
<br>- Not already........ Replied Oxal
<br>- Oh yeah! We have a lot of see today, I hope you're ready. Take a little snack and we are ready to go.
<br>- Good morning miss Oxal! Said Dawn
<br>Oxal took a muffin she brought out of her bag. She restarted the conversation she had with Dawn the<br> previous day. Oxal told Dawn all she dreamt about, but this time Dawn<br> explained her why Under Island closed.
<br>- It was a really long time ago... It was a beautiful day till a really<br> nice creature started attacking a citizen for no reason... That day, Enrick decided<br> to closed Under Island to protect everyone and that day was the beginning<br> of the sad days of Under Island.
<br>- Oh, that's really bad... It's almost impossible that a creature attack for <br>no reason. Where's that creature now? Asked Oxal
<br>- He is hidden and I don't know where he is... Replied Dawn.
<br>- I know where he is... Said Enrick.
<br>- Can't we go see him and tell him to explain why he did that? Asked Oxal.
<br>- I'm not going to visit him.
<br>- PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE.... Yelled Oxal.
<br>- Okay Fine! Stop asking, but I'm not talking to him! Said Enrick.
<br>- I'll talk! Said Oxal.
<br>All of them walked up a really big mountain and on the way up Enrick was telling Oxal<br> everything about this little creature she was going to meet. After a while of climbing, they finally got to a cave entrance.<br> It was really dark inside the cave and a little cold wind was coming out of there. Oxal,<br>Dawn and Enrick entered the cave one by one. In the cave, there was a lot of plants and some <br>insects walking on the walls. Suddenly they all heard a really loud noise, they all stopped but continued right after...<br> Oxal was getting a little worried but she wanted to fix the problem and reopen Under Island. 
<br>- Hello... Is there anyone here? Asked Oxal with a shaking voice.
<br>- What do you want. Replied the creature.
<br>- Can I ask you some questions? It's about the day you attacked someone, I want to understand,<br> because I’m sure you haven't done that for no reason.
<br>- You want to know the story?? Here it is: That day I was really happy to meet people like every <br>day! Everything was going perfectly, then a really weird person entered <br>and I felt like something wasn’t okay, I could feel something was about to happen, so <br>I started looking out for everything, making sure everything was alright, <br>when I saw the guy stealing some of our resources and stealing some of our creatures and taking foods from the creatures.<br> I had to protect Under Island, I wasn't going to let him escape like this, so I jumped on him to free the creatures<br> and everything he stole. Everyone thought I was attacking him for no reason and when I tried to explain everything to Enrick, he didn't listen to <br>me and closed our magical Under Island and now no one talk to me and everyone is scared of me.
<br>The little creature started crying... Suddenly Enrick started feeling bad. Before Oxal could say<br>anything, Enrick talked.
<br>- I am sorry buddy... I always thought you attacked him for no reason, but I didn’t take the time<br> to actually listen to what you had to say. If I can do anything for you <br>to forgive me, I will do it...
<br>- There's one thing you can do... Reopen Under Island. I don't care if people are still ignoring <br>me after this or if everyone is still scared of me, but I just want everyone<br> to know that we still exist and that there's an amazing community under<br> Fantasy Island. replied Tim, the creature.
<br>- If that is what you really want, I will Tim… Said Enrick.
<br>A few days later, Enrick was announcing the big reopening of Under Island, and explained to <br>everyone what happen and gave a public apologize to Tim. He also named the little creature,<br> the new king of Under Island, and since that day, Dawn rebuilt a new village with all <br>her new friends and Tim made a bunch of new friends which rapidly became his best friends. <br>Now humans and Under Island creatures live together in peace for the rest of their life.
<br>The End
